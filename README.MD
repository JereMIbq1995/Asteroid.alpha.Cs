To run the project, do the following:<br>

First, set up the project by running:<br>
    <b>./build</b>
<br>
Note: This build command should only be executed once
        right after you clone the repo. If you run it again,
        it's probably fine. But you shouldn't have to.

Next, run the project:<br>
    <b>dotnet run</b>
